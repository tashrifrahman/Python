1. What is a String in Programming?

   A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text. In Python, strings are immutable sequences of Unicode characters, 
   enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes. They support indexing, slicing, and various methods for text manipulation.


2. Difference Between String, Word, and Sentence in Text Processing.

   String: Any sequence of characters (may include letters, digits, punctuation, whitespace).

   Word: A token representing a meaningful unit of text, usually a contiguous run of alphabetic characters or alphanumeric characters.

   Sentence: A higher-level unit — a sequence of words and punctuation that expresses a complete thought; often detected by sentence 
             boundary detection (e.g., punctuation like . ? ! plus rules).


3. What is String Immutability, and Why Does It Matter?

   String immutability means once a string object is created, it cannot be changed. Operations that look like modifications actually create new string objects. 
   It matters because:

   -> Improves safety (no accidental changes shared across references).

   -> Enables optimizations (interning, caching, hashability for dict keys).

   -> Predictable behavior when strings are used as keys in dictionaries.


4. What Are Common String Operations Used in NLP?

   Common operations:

  - Tokenization: split text into tokens (words/subwords).

  - Lowercasing / normalization: unify case and remove diacritics.

  - Stemming / lemmatization: reduce words to stems or lemmas.

  - Stopword removal: drop common words.

  - POS tagging / chunking: annotate tokens with grammatical roles.

  - n-gram extraction: build sequences of n tokens.

  - Regex-based cleaning: remove noise, URLs, mentions.

  - Subword encoding: BPE/WordPiece for model inputs.


5. What Is Tokenization, and How Is It Related to Strings?

   Tokenization is the process of splitting text into smaller units (tokens), such as words or subwords.
   It directly operates on strings — the input is a string, and the output is a list of strings (tokens). 
   It’s a fundamental step in NLP preprocessing.
